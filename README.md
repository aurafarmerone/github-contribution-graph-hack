# 🧠 GitHub Commit Lab (Github-Contribution-Graph-Hack)

Create **custom patterns, text, or designs** on your GitHub contribution graph using automated commits.

This project is a **Python-based script** that takes a generated `pattern.json` file and converts it into **real GitHub commits**, making your contribution graph display the desired pattern using green dots.

> 🎯 Built for learning, fun, and open-source experimentation.


## ✨ What Does This Project Do?

#### 🕰️Act as a Time Machine for Your GitHub Graph

Think of this project as a **time machine** 🚀 for your GitHub contribution graph.

We all have moments where:
- We were inactive for months
- Made mistakes
- Forgot to push code
- Or simply didn’t know GitHub well enough

This tool lets you **travel back in time** and visualize patterns on your contribution graph by converting a generated `pattern.json` into **real commits with past dates**.

It doesn’t change who you are —  
it just helps you **experiment, learn, and have fun** with how GitHub graphs work.

> ✨ Wash away old gaps, explore commit history mechanics, and create something visually cool — responsibly.


## 🖼 Example Output
Here’s what a generated pattern looks like on a GitHub profile:

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

GitHub contribution graph is:
- **7 rows** → days of the week  
- **52 columns** → weeks in a year  

This script:
1. Reads your pattern grid  
2. Converts active cells into commit dates  
3. Creates commits using Git  
4. GitHub shows them as green dots  

No fake rendering — **real commits, real graph**.


## 🚀 How To Use


### 1️⃣ Generate `pattern.json`

This script **requires a pattern file**.

You can generate it using my pattern generator website or from my repository:

 🌐 **GitHub Pattern Generator**  
👉 https://github-pattern-generator.web.app/

**OR**

 🌐 **GitHub  REPOSITORY**  
👉 https://github.com/aurafarmerone/github-pattern-generator

Steps:
- Open the website  
- Design your text or pattern  
- Download `pattern.json`  
- Place it in this repository by replacing old "pattern.json"

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is created **just for fun, learning, and experimentation**.

❗ Please do **NOT**:
- Mislead others using your contribution graph  
- Claim fake activity during interviews  
- Use this for unfair advantages  

Be honest — skills matter more than graphs.
